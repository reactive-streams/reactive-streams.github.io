Reactive Streams 1.0.0 is here!
===============================


It is with great pleasure that we—the *Reactive Streams Special Interest Group*—are announcing the immediate availability of the final form of _Reactive Streams_—after countless hours of prototyping, discussions, debate, evaluations, programming, testing, specifying requirements, documenting, and refining—we are confident that we have found the essential solution to the problem that we set out to solve:
